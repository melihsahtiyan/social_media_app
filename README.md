# Node.js and TypeScript

We use _Node.js_ environment and _TypeScript_ language. For a guide on getting started with _Node.js_ and _TypeScript_, check out these [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

_Node.js_ is a runtime environment that enables the execution of _JavaScript_ code outside of a web browser. It serves as a platform for the development of scalable network applications like web servers, utilizing _JavaScript_.

On the other hand, _TypeScript_ is a statically typed superset of _JavaScript_ that introduces optional types to the language. It is transpiled to _JavaScript_ and can be executed in any _JavaScript_ environment, including _Node.js_.

## Advantages of Node.js

1. _Node.js_ is built on _Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine_, rendering it highly efficient for executing _JavaScript_ code.
2. It supports high scalability due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
3. _Node.js_ boasts a large and active community, leading to frequent updates and a vast array of reusable modules accessible through _npm_, the _Node Package Manager_.

## Advantages of TypeScript

1. _TypeScript_ facilitates early detection of errors through static type checking, thereby leading to safer and more reliable code.
2. It offers superior tooling and editor support, delivering features such as autocompletion and refactoring.
3. _TypeScript_ enhances code readability and comprehension through its type annotations, a feature particularly beneficial in large codebases.

# Express.js

_Express.js_ is a minimalist web framework for _Node.js_. It simplifies server creation, allowing easy setup of middlewares, routing rules, and additional functionalities. It streamlines backend development in Node.js.

1. _Express.js_ simplifies server creation in _Node.js_, making backend development more efficient.
2. It allows easy setup of middlewares, enabling developers to add additional functionalities to their applications.
3. _Express.js_ provides a robust set of routing rules, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages with ease.
4. It streamlines backend development in _Node.js_, saving developers time and effort.
5. The minimalist nature of _Express.js_ makes it lightweight and fast, potentially improving the performance of applications.

# MongoDB Atlas

We use _MongoDB Atlas_ for our database. For a guide on getting started with _MongoDB_, check out this [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

_MongoDB Atlas_ is a fully-managed cloud database service provided by _MongoDB_. It allows you to deploy, operate, and scale your databases on the cloud.

Advantages:

1. It offers high availability and consistency due to the use of a distributed database architecture.
2. It has built-in security features such as network isolation, encryption at rest and in transit, and robust access controls.
